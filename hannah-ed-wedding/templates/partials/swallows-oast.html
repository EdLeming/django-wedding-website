            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>
                We're keen to keep things as easy as possible for all our guests. With that in mind we've hired out a campsite
                adjacent to the venue (5 min walk) for those of you who want to keep it close. You can pitch your own tent
                for Â£25 or book a glamping tent if you want to live it up a little. There are shower and toilet facilites
                on the campsite - and BBQ space for cooking your breakfast bacon. If you're interested please contact
                the campsite via the details below.
